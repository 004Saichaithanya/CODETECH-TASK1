## Project Overview

This project is a professional portfolio website developed as part of the CODETECH-TASK1 assignment. It showcases my skills, projects, and professional experiences in a visually appealing manner. The portfolio includes various sections to introduce myself, highlight my technical skills, showcase projects, and provide contact information for potential clients or employers.

The goal of this portfolio is to create a modern, user-friendly, and responsive interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap on the frontend, with Flask serving as the backend framework. This allows for easy future updates and additions as I expand my skill set and project experience.
